## Overview

This repository contains code and datasets designed for skin analysis, including image processing algorithms, feature extraction methods, and potentially machine learning models for skin classification or segmentation.

## Features

- Skin image preprocessing and enhancement
- Feature extraction from skin images (texture, color, etc.)
- Sample datasets for testing and experimentation
- Jupyter Notebooks for interactive analysis
- Modular and extensible codebase

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ganashree1612/skin_analysis.git
cd skin_analysis
```

Install dependencies (Python example):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

- Place your skin images inside the appropriate directory (e.g., `data/images/`).
- Run the main analysis scripts or notebooks:
    - Example: `python analyze.py --input data/images/sample.jpg`
    - Or explore the `notebooks/` for step-by-step guides.
